                    Obviously, you're thinking - what the fuck are all these plans? Why would I pay 30 EUR per month or 300 EUR per year? Well obviously you don't <strong>need</strong> to pay anything. We're just going to switch up how we do things.
                    <br>
                    <br> From now on, we're stirring things up. There's a total of 6 plans (1 free, 4 recurring, 1 one-time), in the future your accounts will get classes according to your payment. Down below is a list of all plans starting on November 1st 2017:

                    The free plan means you didn't donate anything. No worries! You can still watch/listen/read everything, however - that's where it ends. There's no support, you're not allowed to request and you cannot ask for subtitles on demand.
                    <br>
                    <br> The basic plan means you either donate 7,50 EUR per month or 75 EUR per year. Thanks! This means you can not only watch/listen/read everything, but you also get support, subtitles on demand and you're allowed to request anything you want! As long as you do actually plan to watch it ofcourse.
                    <br>
                    <br> The standard plan is the best plan in our opinion, most bang-for-buck! This means you either donate 15 EUR per month or 150 EUR per year! Amazing! With this you not just get the basic plan, but you also get read access to our FTP, whaaaat! This means you can download <strong>everything</strong> available on the server!
                    <br>
                    <br> The premium plan means you either donate 20 EUR per month or 200 EUR per year! Wow! You now get the standard plan <strong>plus</strong> your very own cloud! A cloud? Yes! Your own storage, your own password manager and more! You can ask us what you can do with the cloud!
                    <br>
                    <br> The unlimited plan is our premium plus plus plus plan! You either donate 30 EUR per month or 300 EUR per year! Ho-ly shit! You not just get the content, support, cloud and request - but you get your very own virtual machine with support! Sky's the limit! Set up your own voicechat, game server, full access to the servers data and more! E-mail server@hiddenprocess.com for more info! To top the unlimited plan off, you can even request <strong>services</strong>. This means you can request whatever web service we can arrange for you.
